Anchor-n-Explore
================

Development Status: WIP

A GoogleMaps-based Application for Firefox OS that helps you explore new places. The main idea behind this app is to set up an ‘Anchor’ location on the map, so that the app always shows the shortest route from your current location to the ‘Anchor’.

Features:

•  Set Anchor as: Current Location OR Custom Location

•	Display route from Current Location to the Anchor

•	Search for Places

  o	Display route from Current Location to the Place, also displaying the route from Current Location to the Anchor

•	Enhancement: Offline Support of Route from Last Current Location to the Anchor
